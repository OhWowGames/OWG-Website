                agreement with You and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> Processing Personal Data is necessary for compliance with a legal

            years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to
            the
